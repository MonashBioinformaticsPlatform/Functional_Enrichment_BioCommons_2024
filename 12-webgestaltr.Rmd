LIST OF AMAZING THINGS ABOUT WEBGESTALTR:
- makes great html reports with interactive plots and links to external dbs
- saves the results to disk when running, no need to export stuf and save files manually 
- many dbs and gene lists supported (n = 70) 
- supports metabolomics, with 15 different ID types, see new paper https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/W1/W415/7684598#google_vignette 
- can be used for novel species, but i havent tried it yet... 
- does ORA, GSEA, and NTA. I wonder if the NTA works at all for novel species???! 
- super easy to run. many supported namespaces (n = 73), does not require conversions for different functions like clusterProfiler, can even have different napesapce for ORA gene list and background list 
- "Multiple databases in a vector are supported for ORA and GSEA"
