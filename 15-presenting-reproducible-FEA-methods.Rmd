# Presenting reproducible FEA methods




Duration: 10 minutes 
Purpose of the activity: Promote awareness of and thinking about reproducibility in scientific methods, and what details from FEA are important for reproducibility. Encourage a space of active and collaborative participation to finish off the workshop, in order to promote participant confidence in asking questions. 


This will be some kind of real time document or PollEV where participants can type free text (with a word/character limit?) under the headings/sections of “Materials and Methods” and “Results”. All participants can see what others are typing but the responses are anonymous
During the webinar, we have raised the fact that reproducibility is key, because so many small changes to the analysis can change the results, and there are many peer reviewed articles that have critiqued a lack of reproducibility and serial under-reporting of methods in studies that report FEA. 
Ideal responses will be things like “include the name of the tool and its version”, “ multiple testing correction was performed with the Benjamni-Hochberg method and enrichments filted for adjusted P value < 0.05”, “the statistical background gene list is included in the supplementary methods” etc 
During/after real time participant responses, we can highlight common themes, add any that are missing from the generated list. 
I wonder if we could find a paper that has really awesome reproducible detail as an example and include the link in the material…
