# GSEA with clusterProfiler and visualisation with enrichplot


[clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) is a comprehensive suite of enrichment tools. It has functions to run ORA or GSEA over commonly used databases (GO, KEGG, KEGG Modules, DAVID, Pathway Commons, WikiPathways) as well as universal enrichment functions to perform ORA or GSEA with custom gene sets. We will use these universal tools in the final activity of this workshop, focusing on the supported organisms and datbases for the present activity. 

The same authors have released a companion plotting package [enrichplot](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/enrichplot.html) dedicated to plotting enrichment results. In this activity, we will perform GSEA with `clusterProfiler` then explore many different visualisation options. At the end of the activity, we will have a poll to see which of the many plot types are the favourites! üòÅ

## Supported databases, species and namespaces

One of the challenges when working with `clusterProfiler` for FEA is that each enrichment function has different supported organisms and different namespace requirements, so you can not necessarily use all of the functions over the same gene list. In this activity, we will review the FEA functions and investigate their requirements, before performing a gene ID conversion with the `bitr` function to enable compatability with our [Pezzini et al 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10571-016-0403-y) dataset. 

Let's start by reviewing the dedicated database enrichment functions and what inbuilt support they have.

To obtain this information, 3 sources were required: 

1. The [clusterProfiler user guide](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/clusterProfiler/man/clusterProfiler.pdf)
2. External websites ([Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.20/data/annotation/) and [KEGG Organisms](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html))
3. `clusterProfiler` functions (eg `get_wp_organisms()`, `keytypes(org.Hs.eg.db)`)

This highlights the need to carefully review the tool you are using and explore the user guide and functionality.

## Activity overview


Since we have covered ORA with `gprofiler`, we will perform a GSEA with `clusterProfiler` using `gseKEGG`.  

1. Explore the functions of `clusterProfiler` including which FEA functions support which organisms and which namespaces
2. Load input dataset (a gene matrix with adjusted P values and log2 fold change values) 
3. Extract the gene IDs and sort by log2 fold change to create the GSEA ranked gene list R object
4. Use `bitr` to convert gene IDs from ENSEMBL to ENTREZ for compatability with `gseKEGG`
5. Perform GSEA with `gseKEGG`
6. Visualise results with `enrichplot`

&#x27A4; Go back to your RStudio interface and clear your environment by selecting `Session` &rarr; `Quit session` &rarr; `Dont save` &rarr; `Start new session`



&#x27A4; Open the `clusterProfiler.Rmd` notebook

&#x27A4; Load the notebook `gprofiler2.Rmd` notebook by clicking on it in the `Files` pane

You could also open the file by selecting `File` &rarr; `Open file`, or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl + o`.
